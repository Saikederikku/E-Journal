<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>04/05/2024 (17:23):</b> I have started making this website. It will be a log of interesting things that happen to me, mainly just so I remember stuff.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>04/05/2024 (17:41):</b> The website has been uploaded and setup on Netlify. It is now up, so if I want to show it to anyone outside of the house, I can.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>05/05/2024 (10:27):</b> Brought a portable TV, an old phone an some other things for £8.50 today. I have created a new name for this site: E-Journal.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>05/05/2024 (10:38):</b> The name "E-Journal" has already been taken on Netlify... Gonna have to settle for my plan B title: E-Log. Nowhere near as good as the original title.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>05/05/2024 (11:15):</b> Bad news... My netlify account has been suspended. I'm not sure why though. I think that I might have to use something else.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>05/05/2024 (11:29):</b> I've set up the website on Github. It should be live now, since I set it as public. Oh, and the name "E-Journal" wasn't taken either.</h3></p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;"><h3><b>06/05/2024 (17:13):</b> I have been doing some HTML tests recently. I made a website with multiple pages, but it's not online/up yet.</h3></p>
